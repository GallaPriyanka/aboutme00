                <h1>Current</h1>
                    I started my Masters in Applied Computer Science at the NorthWest Missouri State University, this Spring 2019.
                    I should be graduating for my post graduation by the end of Fall 2020.

                <h2>Plans</h2>
                    I am from a town called Guntur (in Andhra Pradesh), India.
                    All my schooling took place in my hometown. I pursued my Under Graduation (BTech) in Computer Science and Engineering(CSE) at RVR & JC College of Engineering, Guntur.
                    Later I worked for the Tata Consultancy Service(TCS) as a DataBase developer for 1.5 years.
                    My job included working on technologies like SQL, PLSQL, Unix and Informatica.
                    I spend my free time by solving sudoku, puzzles and mystery riddles.

                    My dream is to get into the Google company as a developer.
                    I want to be a Java or DataBase developer because I am very much interested in Java and SQL programming and DataBase Management Systems(DBMS).
                    I like the work that involves programming and solving problems with creative thinking.

                <h2>Aside</h2>
                    I like to spend more time with my family and help my parents in their work.
                    I always want to make them as proud of me as I was of them.
